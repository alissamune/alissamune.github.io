*I enjoy solving complicated puzzles, mainly using R language. I like finishing projects, but love developing them.*

Currently, I live in SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil, and work as Data Scientist in a Digital Marketing Agency. My main attributions are maintaining our infrastructure and helping create and automate models that assist and optimise decision making in our Digital Performance teams on a daily basis. I also perform recurrent analysis in order to detect and provide solution for problems our clients might be having, trying to inovate as much as I can, of course!

I'm specially enthusiastic of diversity in STEM fields. My true passion for Data Science started when I met amazing people in the first *R-Ladies SP* meetup, back in 2018.
